## Prerequisites

- Telegraf 1.31.2 or higher
- Python 3.12.3 or higher
- Access to Cisco Catalyst Center API endpoints

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```git clone https://github.com/Walkablenormal/cisco-catalyst-center-telegraf.git```
   
    ```cd cisco-catalyst-center-telegraf```
2. Install required Python packages:
   
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
  
3. Copy the Telegraf configuration file to your Telegraf config directory:

   ```cp * /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/```

## Configuration

1. Open the `config.py` file and update the following parameters:

- `BASE_URL`: URL of your Cisco Catalyst Center instance (string)
- `USERNAME`: Your Catalyst Center API username (string)
- `PASSWORD`: Your Catalyst Center API password (string)
- `SSL_VERIFY`: True if the certificate your Catalyst Center deployent uses is singed by a trusted CA. (bool)

Currently, this file contains the credentials of the Cisco DevNet Always-On Catalyst Center Sandbox.

## Usage

1. Start Telegraf with the new configuration:

```systemctl restart telegraf```

2. Verify that data is being collected by checking your configured output destination (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus, etc.).
